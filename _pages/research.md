Fabric-enriched damage mechanics
======
General rules that would allow one to connect continuum behavior to the micro-scale features (e.g., the geometry of cracks, pores, and grains) are of great significance in geomechanics. Our goal is to propose a fabric-enriched damage mechanics framework to understand the damage accumulation in geomaterials. Uniaxial consolidation tests and cyclic compression tests were conducted on reagent-grade granular salt in dry conditions at 150 C. 2D-microscopic images, parallel to the axis of loading, were obtained at several stages of tests. Microstructure image analyses were performed to obtain probability density functions (PDFs) of the area, solidity, coordination number, orientation, elongation and roundness of the grains, as well as the PDFs of the branch lengths, branch orientations and solid volume fraction, defined locally over polygons with edges matching grain centroids. The Discrete Wing Crack Elastoplastic Damage (DWCPD) Model was proposed based on the microscopic observations to characterize the initiation and propagation of microcracks in the polycrystalline materials. Fabric tensors are going to be calculated to assess microstructure anisotropy and its effects on the stiffness tensors.
